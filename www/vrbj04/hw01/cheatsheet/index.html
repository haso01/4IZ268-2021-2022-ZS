                    According to all known laws
                    of aviation,

                    there is no way a bee
                    should be able to fly.

                    Its wings are too small to get
                    its fat little body off the ground.

                    The bee, of course, flies anyway

                    because bees don't care
                    what humans think is impossible.

                    Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
                    Yellow, black. Yellow, black.

                    Ooh, black and yellow!
                    Let's shake it up a little.

                    Barry! Breakfast is ready!

                    Ooming!

                    Hang on a second.

                    Hello?

                    - Barry?
                    - Adam?

                    - Oan you believe this is happening?
                    - I can't. I'll pick you up.

                    Looking sharp.

                    Use the stairs. Your father
                    paid good money for those.

                    Sorry. I'm excited.

                    Here's the graduate.
                    We're very proud of you, son.

                    A perfect report card, all B's.

                    Very proud.

                    Ma! I got a thing going here.

                    - You got lint on your fuzz.
                    - Ow! That's me!

                    - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
                    - Bye!

        <h1>Kapitola 2</h1>
        <p>A classic example of internet <abbr title="Bullshit">bs</abbr>:</p>
        <figure>
            <blockquote cite="https://www.twitchquotes.com/copypastas/labels/classic">
                <pre>
"Who’s joe?" a distant voice asks.

Instantly everyone nearby hears the sound of 1,000s of bricks rapidly shuffling towards his
location.

The earth itself seemed to cry out in agony, until finally the ground itself split open and a
horrific creature crawled from the ground, covered in mucus and tar.

”Joe Momma…” the creature whispered.

The man cried out in pain as he disintegrated into dust, and the whole world fell silent in fear.

"I did a little trolling." the wretched creature remarked before burrowing back into the earth.
