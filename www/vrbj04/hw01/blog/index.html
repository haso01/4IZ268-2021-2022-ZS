            <h1>Malta vs Penguins</h1>
            <p>
                This does not change the fact that in Antarctica there are 21 million penguins and in Malta there are
                502,653 inhabitants. So if the penguins decide to invade Malta, each Maltese will have to fight 42
                penguins.

            <h1>My Grandfather</h1>
            <p>
                My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever
                want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes
                when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung
                cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put
                your family through what your Grandfather put us through." I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a
                cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because your post
                gave me cancer anyway.

                Hey guys, my monitor isn't working. I have to print out chat in order to read it. The paper and ink are
                really expensive, so please don't spam! Thank you.
